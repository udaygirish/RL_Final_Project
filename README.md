## Current Motion Primitives - Base

Currently, we are following motion primitives as below as suggested in class

- forward movement at the current altitude
- 45 degree left at the current altitude 
- 45 degree right at the current altitude 
- forward and up
- 45 degree right and up
- 45 degree left and up
- forward and down
- 45 degree right and down
- 45 degree left and down 


#### Do we have to chose whether we use Motion primitives directly or motion primitives with count
